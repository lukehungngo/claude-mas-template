# New Feature

Scaffold a new feature: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/{{name}}
   ```

2. **Create task spec** using `.claude/templates/task-spec.md`:
   - Fill in Meta, Context, Objective, Acceptance Criteria
   - Save to `docs/tasks/pending/TASK-{next-id}.md`

3. **If research needed** (novel approach):
   - Dispatch Researcher agent
   - Run Research Convergence Protocol (max 3 rounds with Differential Reviewer)
   - Get approved proposal before implementation

4. **If known pattern** (existing code to follow):
   - Identify the pattern in the codebase
   - Reference it in the task spec

5. **Present task spec to human** for approval before implementation.

6. **After approval**, run `/dev-loop` with the approved task spec.
