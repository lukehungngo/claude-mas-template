# Test-Driven Development (TDD)

> If interrupted, re-invoke with the same arguments — this skill is idempotent.

## Overview

Write the test first. Watch it fail. Write minimal code to pass.

**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.

## The Iron Law

```
NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST
```

Write code before the test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions.

## Red-Green-Refactor

### RED — Write Failing Test

Write one minimal test showing what should happen.

**Requirements:**
- One behavior per test
- Clear, descriptive name
- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)

```bash
# Run and confirm FAILURE
{{test-command}} path/to/test
```

Confirm: Test fails (not errors). Failure is expected. Fails because feature is missing.

### GREEN — Minimal Code

Write the simplest code to pass the test. Don't add features, refactor, or "improve" beyond the test.

```bash
# Run and confirm PASS
{{test-command}} path/to/test
```

Confirm: Test passes. Other tests still pass. No warnings.

### REFACTOR — Clean Up

After green only: remove duplication, improve names, extract helpers. Keep tests green. Don't add behavior.

### Repeat

Next failing test for next behavior.

## Common Rationalizations — All Mean "Start Over"

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |
| "I'll test after" | Tests passing immediately prove nothing. |
| "Already manually tested" | Ad-hoc ≠ systematic. No record, can't re-run. |
| "Deleting X hours is wasteful" | Sunk cost fallacy. Keeping unverified code is debt. |
| "Need to explore first" | Fine. Throw away exploration, start with TDD. |
| "TDD will slow me down" | TDD is faster than debugging. |

## Red Flags — STOP and Start Over

- Code before test
- Test passes immediately
- Can't explain why test failed
- "Just this once"
- "Keep as reference"

**All of these mean: Delete code. Start over with TDD.**

## Verification Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Every new function/method has a test
- [ ] Watched each test fail before implementing
- [ ] Each test failed for expected reason
- [ ] Wrote minimal code to pass each test
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No errors or warnings in output
- [ ] Tests use real code (mocks only if unavoidable)
- [ ] Edge cases and error paths covered
