# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Never declare done without running this checklist. "It works on my machine" is not verification.

## Checklist

### Build Verification

- [ ] `{{lint-command}}` — clean, zero warnings
- [ ] `{{typecheck-command}}` — clean, zero errors
- [ ] `{{test-command}}` — all pass, zero failures

### Code Verification

- [ ] `git diff` reviewed — no debug prints, no TODOs, no commented-out code
- [ ] No `.env`, credentials, or secrets in the diff
- [ ] All new functions have type annotations
- [ ] All new functions have tests
- [ ] Edge cases covered (null, empty, large input, concurrent access)

### Spec Verification

- [ ] Original task spec's objective is met
- [ ] All acceptance criteria commands pass
- [ ] Business context requirement is satisfied
- [ ] Only `relevant_files` were modified
- [ ] `do_not_touch` files are untouched

### Requirements Validation (against original PRD/requirement)

- [ ] Every functional requirement from the PRD is implemented — trace through code to confirm
- [ ] Cross-cutting requirements that span multiple tasks are addressed (not lost between task boundaries)
- [ ] Edge cases mentioned in the PRD are handled
- [ ] Overall system behavior matches what was specified — not just individual tasks passing
- [ ] No requirement was silently dropped or partially implemented without documentation

### Regression Verification

- [ ] Existing tests still pass (not just new tests)
- [ ] No unintended side effects on other modules
- [ ] Performance hasn't degraded (if applicable)

## If Any Check Fails

1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run the FULL checklist (not just the failed item)
3. Only declare done when ALL checks pass

## Anti-patterns

- Checking only new tests, not existing ones
- "It compiles" ≠ "it works"
- Skipping the diff review
- Declaring done and fixing "later"
