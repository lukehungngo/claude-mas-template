# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Final verification, present options to human, clean up.

## Process

### Step 1 — Final Verification

```
Skill(skill: "verification")
```

If any check fails → fix before proceeding.

### Step 2 — Review the Diff

```bash
git diff main...HEAD --stat    # Files changed summary
git log main..HEAD --oneline   # Commits in this branch
```

Check:
- [ ] No unintended file changes
- [ ] No debug prints or TODOs
- [ ] No `.env` or secrets committed
- [ ] Commit messages are meaningful

### Step 3 — Present Options to Human

```markdown
## Branch Complete: {branch-name}

### Summary
{2-3 sentences on what was built}

### Changes
- {X} files changed, {Y} insertions, {Z} deletions
- {N} new tests added

### Build Status
- Lint: PASS
- Typecheck: PASS
- Tests: PASS ({total})

### Requirements Coverage
| # | Requirement | Status |
|---|-------------|--------|
| 1 | {from PRD}  | MET / PARTIAL / MISSING |

{Include the Requirements Validation Report from the validation step if available.
If no validation was run, explicitly note: "Requirements validation was not performed."}

### Options
1. **Merge** — `git checkout main && git merge {branch}`
2. **Create PR** — `gh pr create --title "{title}" --body "{body}"`
3. **Keep branch** — Leave as-is for further work
4. **Discard** — `git branch -D {branch}`

Which would you like?
```

### Step 4 — Clean Up (after human chooses)

- If merge/PR: clean up worktree if used
- If discard: delete branch and worktree
- Move all tasks to `docs/tasks/done/`
- Remove worktree: `git worktree remove {path}`
